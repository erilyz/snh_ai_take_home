SNH AI – Engineering Take-Home Challenge

Overview
Build a production-ready HTTP API server for managing hierarchical tree data structures. This challenge
simulates a real-world scenario where your API will be used by other developers and teams.

Core Requirements
Your solution should include:
1. API Endpoints - An HTTP server that exposes two endpoints:
    - GET /api/tree - Returns all trees from the database
    - POST /api/tree - Creates a new node and attaches it to a specified parent node
2. Data Persistence - Implement a persistence layer that retains data between server restarts/stops

Critical constraints:
- Approach this as you would a production API that other developers will integrate with and
maintain.
- Use Python and libraries you're comfortable with.
- Simple straight forward approach
- Cost effective solution as this will be a POC, so for data persistence let's use a storage bucket that can easily
  be upgraded later on.

API Specifications
GET /api/tree
    Returns an array of all trees in the database.

Example Response in JSON:
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "label": "root",
        "children": [
            {
                "id": 3,
                "label": "bear",
                "children": [
                    {
                        "id": 4,
                        "label": "cat",
                        "children": []
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

POST /api/tree
    Creates a new node and attaches it to the specified parent node in the tree.

What We're Looking For
We evaluate submissions holistically across multiple dimensions (critical constraints):
    • Correctness - Does it work as specified?
    • Production-readiness - Could this be deployed and maintained in a real environment?
    • Code quality - Is it clean, well-organized, and easy to understand?
    • Testing approach - How thoroughly is the solution validated?
    • Edge case handling - How does it behave when things go wrong?
    • Documentation - Can another developer understand and work with your code?

Think about what "production-ready" means to you and demonstrate your interpretation through your implementation choices.

Submission Guidelines
    • Include a README with setup and run instructions
    • Make sure all tests can be run easily
    • Feel free to document your design decisions and trade-offs

Estimated time commitment: Most candidates spend 2-4 hours on this challenge. Quality over quantity -
we'd rather see a well-crafted partial solution than a rushed complete one.
